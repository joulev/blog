# blog

... although being called that, this site is not quite a blog site yet. Rather,
it's more like a playground for me to learn and test [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
out.

## Major changes:

* First implementation: [`c1c9789`](https://github.com/joulev/blog/tree/c1c9789abaf35f8ebcc48c003c89275c21914d46)
  [[Deployment]](https://blog-o036wvge3-joulev.vercel.app)

* Second implementation (*current version*): A partial rewrite using Tailwind
  instead of Bootstrap. Sass is no longer used, and some animation was completely
  rewritten using pure CSS only (no more JavaScript).
