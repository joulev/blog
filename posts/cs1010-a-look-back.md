## Module review

The module teaches introductory programming, based on the use of the C
programming language. So, in more details, students are taught about the most
basic of programming, then basic C syntaxes, C good practices, and some
well-known and frequently used algorithms (binary search, sorting, backtracking,
basic graph-searching algorithms, etc.).

Just looking at it, you can well understand the workload of this module is
incredibly high, and the learning curve is really steep. I mean, seriously,
I really went from studying `for` loops to implementing
[DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) within a month. I had
known those algorithms beforehand, so it wasn't much of a problem to me, but I
know [a lot of students](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/qka852/comment/hivf2fg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
really struggled and spent hours or even days working on assignments that are
just worth 3% or 4% of the total grade.

And even if you have prior knowledge, that does **not** necessarily mean you will
pass the module with absolutely no effort. C is such a low-level programming
language that it offers you the ability to directly deal with memories, and that
memory and pointer stuff is really confusing, even for students with prior
experience, trust me. Also, Prof Ooi's CS1010 advocates good practices, so there
is [a massive list](https://nus-cs1010.github.io/2122-s1/c-in-cs1010) of banned
and discouraged syntaxes that did take me a lot of time to get used to.

However, prof and TA's are very helpful. Just like many other CS courses, this
module has a StackOverflow-ish Piazza room where the teaching team was really
active answering questions and providing feedbacks (even when some questions
were so dumb and poorly written that I'm sure they wouldn't get more than a
score of &minus;3 on StackOverflow).

Some of my classmates also asked me questions, and while the majority of them
were clear and very good, I have to admit some are so bad it literally depressed
me. And prof and TA's had to deal with such questions the whole time. That's
just to show their dedication to the module, which I appreciate a lot.

By the way, if you're gonna take CS1010, do read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
and [this](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/401429) *very* carefully, as that is
the standard of asking programming questions, not only in university, but during
the whole of your career.
