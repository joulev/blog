## Module review

This module teaches about, well, the most basic part of mathematics and
computing, namely logical expressions, sets, relations, cardinality,
combinatorics and graphs.

It was incredibly difficult at first, as I had to basically throw everything I
knew about mathematics away to study from the most basic ground up. It was just
incredibly weird and it took lots of time for me to get used to it. So all that
"CS1231? Just S/U" memes are easy to understand.

However, when you get the hold of it, it's actually not that hard. It's
literally a logic module, so just try to think of it logically and write how you
think to the answer sheet. The number of theorems and definitions was really
overwhelming, but they are very closely related (like, you can actually prove
one very easily based on another), so you only need to remember a few in order
to remember everything. In fact, that's how I studied: I only took 2 or 3 hours
before each quiz to have a look at the most important theorems, then I'd be good
to go. Eventually my grades would be always in the upper half of the bell curve.
While I'm not that good to take the top spots, it's definitely far better than
I thought. After all, the module is (right now) pretty enjoyable and isn't as
challenging as some comments indicate.

Professors and teaching assistants held a lot of additional consulting sessions
throughout the semester so that those with questions can ask live. I do think
that's really good and supportive of students, but since I never attended them
I think I'm not in a position to talk about them here.
