## Module review

> I came to the module from the placement test instead of LAJ2202 like other
> students, so my perception might be different.

The module teaches beginner and pre-intermediate Japanese, as a continuation of
LAJ2202. All content is within the coverage of *Minna no Nihongo 2*.

Having finished *Tobira* before this module completely by self-studying, I was
kinda disappointed that I could only get to LAJ2203 which is still a
pre-intermediate module, as I would expect to get to a more advanced module.
It turned out I was wrong.

Indeed, the grammar was not a problem for me at all. I already knew (and used)
most of the grammar points before the module, so could do the grammar part of
the module quite well without much effort. That doesn't mean I could pass it
in a breeze though; in fact, *sensei* explained quite carefully about the
differences of similar grammar structures, such as こと vs の when going with
verbs, or the use cases of conditional forms 〜たら vs 〜ば vs 〜と vs 〜なら. They
are important points that can be easily ignored or forgotten when one
self-studies it, so it was of big help for me.

The vocabulary part was not so smooth. In fact, I wonder if all the textbooks
I had studied before the module had some vocabulary pages ripped off. Indeed
I already knew lots of *kanji* and words introduced in advance, but the number
of completely new words is not small. It was also a bit disadvantageous for me
since my mother tongue doesn't use kanji like many of my classmates (Chinese,
Chinese Singaporean, etc.), but luckily thanks to all those months of hard work
in self-studying, my kanji base was pretty solid, so the disadvantage was
pretty much cancelled out.

However, what this module offers the most to me is probably the tutorial
sessions where I could practice speaking *a lot*. Self-study means one can't
practice speaking properly, so it made my speaking skills really terrible
(probably that's also why I couldn't get to a higher module after the placement
test interview). But the tutorials, where we were basically allocated to
groups and given topics or context to talk about, really helped me a lot about
that. After the module, now I can say if I know enough vocabulary and grammar to
express an idea in writing, I can do it in speaking too. Balancing between the
four main skills (listening, reading, writing and speaking) is one of the main
goals of language courses, and I think LAJ2203 did a really good job at that.

In a learning journal entry, I wrote that, despite my initial disappointment
before the module, I finally found out that LAJ2203 was indeed the most suitable
course for the me of three months ago.

I still stand with this opinion.
