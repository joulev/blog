## Module review

As the name suggests, the module teaches about a lot of new concepts in
calculus, especially multiple-variable calculus. Basically a new topic with many
new related concepts/theorems and several problem types were brought up every
week. Although the number of quizzes isn't very high (only three quiz for three
weekends), it still made me quite busy, and the exam period really required
quite a lot of effort. I do think that jamming this inside a mini-semester makes
it a bit rushed.

That said, the quizzes and the exam was pretty easy though. As long as one gets
the general idea of it, the questions aren't very challenging, and it doesn't
require you to think much outside of what is taught and practised in class.

There is one problem I have with the module though. It's not very important, and
it might even not be applicable to most people, but it still bugs me all the
time: the design of the slides. The slides Prof made are very well structured
and did their jobs, which was to store information and show it in a way students
can understand, very well. However, they aren't the most pretty slides around,
so people who advocate for design elegance and beauty like me will probably not
be satisfied.
