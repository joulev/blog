## Module review

The module teaches about differential equations, namely how to solve first-order
and second-order differential equations, as well as a bit about Laplace
transformations and multiple-variable differential equations.

Despite it being only 2 MC's, it's definitely the hardest module that I took this
semester. Partly because of the complicated nature of differential equations,
and partly because, just like [MA1511](/posts/ma1511-a-look-back), this module
deserves a whole semester instead of just 7 weeks.

Well... that's it. Since this module only took me 2 hours per week as I was too
lazy to wake up at 9am for tutorials... I guess I'm not in a position to say
more.
